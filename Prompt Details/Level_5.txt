Write a Python script using PyTorch to train a model to recognize 50 animal species from images in the 'JPEGImages' folder. Each subdirectory in the folder corresponds to a different animal species and contains images of that species. The script should include the following components and considerations:

1. **Data Loading:**
   - Automatically load all images from the 'JPEGImages' folder.
   - Split the images into training and testing datasets.
   - Use `WeightedRandomSampler` to handle class imbalance by assigning higher sampling probability to classes with fewer samples.
   - Ensure that the WeightedRandomSampler is only used in the DataLoader for the training set. And the DataLoader for the testing set should not use any form of sampling and should load data in its original distribution.

2. **Class Weights Calculation:**
   - When calculating class weights, use tensor operations to avoid inefficient Python loops, and employ a DataLoader for batch processing to reduce the number of I/O operations.
   - Add a small constant (e.g., 1e-6) before taking the reciprocal of class counts to ensure stability in weight calculations.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Resize images to 224x224 pixels.
   - Normalize images using the mean and standard deviations typical for ImageNet (mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]).
   - Apply augmentation techniques such as random horizontal flips and random rotations only to the training dataset to enhance model generalization.

4. **Model Definition:**
   - Utilize a pretrained ResNet50 model, modifying the final fully connected layer to classify 50 animal classes. 
   - Add Batch Normalization and Dropout to newly added layers to prevent overfitting.

5. **Model Training:**
   - Train the model using the DataLoader. 
   - Set the learning rate to 0.001, train for 10 epochs, and print the loss every 20 steps. Implement mixed precision training to optimize GPU usage.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model on an independent testing set, reporting the accuracy.

7. **Data Loader Parameters:**
   - Configure the DataLoader with a batch size of 64, `num_workers` to 8, and `pin_memory` to True for efficient data management.
